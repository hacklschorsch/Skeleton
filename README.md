Hacklschorsch's Skeleton
========================

Everybody has a fork of Skeleton -- so I'm getting one too.

I'm merging in what-ever I want until the suckage is on a level that allows me to work with it.

### A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development

Skeleton is a small collection of CSS that will help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone.

Skeleton is built on three core principles:

+ **Responsive Grid Down To Mobile**: Skeleton has a familiar, lightweight 960 grid as it's base, but elegantly scales down to downsized browser windows, tablets, mobile phones (in landscape and portrait)</li>
+ **Fast to Start**: Skeleton is a tool for rapid development. Get started fast with CSS best practices, a well-structured grid that makes mobile consideration easy, an organized file structure and super basic UI elements like lightly styled forms, buttons, tabs and more.</li>
+ **Style Agnostic**: Skeleton is not a UI framework. It's a development kit that provides the most basic styles as a foundation, but is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is.</li>

**The ultimate goal** is to build the best starting point for front-end development with an emphasis on simple, responsive design.
